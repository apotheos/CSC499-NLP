associates won't

ninten! what are
you, seasick?

you should shape
up, pal!


sony: i heard
there was a cut
master on board.

but, he was just a
seasick, old man!

but, cut itself is
really useful!

you should go see
him! smell ya!


our captain is a
sword master!

he even teaches
cut to pokémon!


the party's over.
the ship will be
departing soon.


scrubbing decks
is hard work!

i stepped out to
get some air.


hey matey!

jig!


you're
impressive!


how many kinds of
pokémon do you
think there are?


ahoy there!
are you seasick?


i was
just careless!


my pa said there
are 100 kinds of
pokémon. i think
there are more.

we're busy here!
out of the way!


i saw an odd ball
in the trash.

wigglytuff: puup

only friends!

i collected these
pokémon from all
around the world!


oh no!
i went around the
world for these!


you hurt my poor
worldly pokémon!

i demand that you
heal them at a
pokémon center!


waiter, i would
like a cherry pie
please!


a cruise is so
elegant yet cozy!


i always travel
with wigglytuff!


we are cruising
around the world.


ssh! i'm a global
police agent!

i'm on the trail
of team rocket!


in all my travels
i've never seen
any pokémon sleep
like this one!

it was something
like this!


ah yes, i have
seen some pokémon
ferry people
across the water!


pokémon can cut
down small bushes.


have you gone to
the safari zone
in fuchsia city?

it had many rare
kinds of pokémon!!


me and my daddy
think the safari
zone is awesome!


the captain looked
really sick and
pale!


i hear many people
get seasick!


competing against
the young keeps
me youthful.


good
fight! ah, i feel
young again!


15 years ago, i
would have won!


check out what i
fished up!


i'm
all out!


party?

the cruise ship's
party should be
over by now.


which do you like,
a strong or a
rare pokémon?


i must
salute you!


i prefer strong
and rare pokémon.


i never saw you
at the party.


take
it easy!


oh, i adore your
strong pokémon!


machoke: gwoh!
goggoh!


you know what they
say about sailors
and fighting!


right!
good fight, mate!


haha! want to be
a sailor, mate?


my sailor's pride
is at stake!


your
spirit sank me!


did you see the
fishing guru in
vermilion city?


us sailors have
pokémon too!


ok,
you're not bad.


we caught all our
pokémon while
out at sea!


i like feisty
kids like you!


argh!
lost it!


sea pokémon live
in deep water.
you'll need a rod!


matey, you're
walking the plank
if you lose!


argh!
beaten by a kid!


jellyfish some-
times drift into
the ship.


hello stranger!
stop and chat!

all my pokémon
are from the sea!


darn!
i let that one
get away!


i was going to
make you my
assistant too!


my buddy, machoke,
is super strong!

he has enough
strength to move
big rocks!


i heard rumors of
a child prodigy!


the
rumors were true!


you beat giovanni
of team rocket?


i'll show you just
how good you are!


i'm
furious!


you showed me just
how good i was!


only the chosen
can pass here!


i
don't believe it!


all trainers here
are headed to the
pokémon league!
be careful!


trainers live to
seek stronger
opponents!


oh!
so strong!


by fighting tough
battles, you get
stronger!


why...?


who are you? how
did you get here?


oww!
beaten!


are you dissing
team rocket?


you broke into
our operation?


burnt!


you're not going
to get away with
this, brat!


intruder alert!


i
can't do it!


silph scope?
i don't know
where it is!


why did you come
here?


this
won't do!


ok, i'll talk!
take the elevator
to see my boss!


are you lost, you
little rat?


uh-oh, that fight
opened the door!


boss said you can
see ghosts with
the silph scope!


i
surrender!


the team rocket
hq has 4 basement
floors. can you
reach the boss?


stop meddling in
team rocket's
affairs!


oof!
taken down!


silph scope?
the machine the
boss stole. it's
here somewhere.


we got word from
upstairs that you
were coming!


what?
i lost? no!


go ahead and go!
but, you need the
lift key to run
the elevator!


so! i must say, i
am impressed you
got here!


what!
this cannot be!


i see that you
raise pokémon
with utmost care.

a child like you
would never
understand what i
hope to achieve.

i shall step
aside this time!

i hope we meet
again...


i know you! you
ruined our plans
at mt.moon!


burned
again!


do you have
something against
team rocket?


how can you not
see the beauty of
our evil?


ayaya!


boss! i'm sorry i
failed you!


the elevator
doesn't work? who
has the lift key?


no!


oh no! i dropped
the lift key!


it appears to
need a key.


eeek!
no! stop! help!

oh, you're not
with team rocket.
i thought...
i'm sorry. here,
please take this!


ninten got
!


tm36 is
selfdestruct!

it's powerful, but
the pokémon that
uses it faints!
be careful.


you don't have any
room for this.


help! i'm a silph
employee.


how
did you know i
was a rocket?


i work for both
silph and team
rocket!


it's off limits
here! go home!


you're
good.


can you solve the
maze in here?


no kids are
allowed in here!


tough!


diamond shaped
tiles are
teleport blocks!

they're hi-tech
transporters!


hey kid! what are
you doing here?


i goofed!


silph co. will
be merged with
team rocket!


i work for silph.
what should i do?


ninten! you and
your pokémon
saved us!


quit messing with
us, kid!


i give
up!


a hint? you can
open doors with a
card key!


i support team
rocket more than
i support silph!


you
really got me!


humph...

team rocket said
that if i helped
them, they'd let
me study pokémon!


sssh! can't you
see i'm hiding?


huh? team rocket
is gone?


team rocket has
taken command of
silph co.!


arrgh!


fwahahaha!
my boss has been
after this place!


my pokémon are my
loyal soldiers!


darn!
you weak pokémon!


the doors are
electronically
locked! a card
key opens them!


intruder spotted!


who
are you?


i better tell the
boss on 11f!


team rocket is
in an uproar over
some intruder.
that's you right?


team rocket took
off! you're our
hero! thank you!


i heard a kid was
wandering around.


boom!


it's not smart
to pick a fight
with team rocket!


we study poké
ball technology
on this floor!


dang!
blast it!


we worked on the
ultimate poké
ball which would
catch anything!


whaaat? there
shouldn't be any
children here?


oh
goodness!


you're only on 5f.
it's a long way
to my boss!


show team rocket
a little respect!


cough...
cough...


which reminds me.

koffing evolves
into weezing!


it's a pokémon
report!

pokémon lab
created porygon,
the first virtual
reality pokémon.


it's a pokémon
report!

over 160 pokémon
techniques have
been confirmed.


it's a pokémon
report!

only when traded
by link-cable.


the rockets came
and took over the
building!


well, better get
back to work!


oh dear, oh dear.
help me please!


we got engaged!
heheh!


look at him! he's
such a coward!


i feel so sorry
for him, i have
to marry him!


team rocket is
trying to conquer
the world with
pokémon!


team rocket ran
because of you!


they must have
targeted silph
for our pokémon
products.


come work for
silph when you
get older!


i am one of the 4
rocket brothers!


flame
out!


no matter!
my brothers will
avenge me!


that rotten
president!

he shouldn't have
sent me to the
tiksi branch!


shoot!


tiksi branch?
it's in russian
no man's land!


you dare betray
team rocket?


you
traitor!


if you stand for
justice, you
betray evil!


oh! hi! you're
not a rocket! you
came to save us?
why, thank you!

i want you to
have this pokémon
for saving us.


it's lapras. it's
very intelligent.

we kept it in our
lab, but it will
be much better
off with you!

i think you will
be a good trainer
for lapras!

it's a good
swimmer. it'll
give you a lift!


team rocket's
boss went to the
boardroom! is our
president ok?


saved at last!
thank you!


team rocket was
after the master
ball which will
catch any pokémon!


we canceled the
master ball
project because
of team rocket.


it would be bad
if team rocket
took over silph
or our pokémon!


wow! you chased
off team rocket
all by yourself?


you! it's really
dangerous here!
you came to save
me? you can't!


safe at last!
oh thank you!


oh ho! i smell a
little rat!


lights
out!


you won't find my
boss by just
scurrying around!


heheh!

you mistook me for
a silph worker?


i'm
done!


despite your age,
you are a skilled
trainer!


i am one of the 4
rocket brothers!


aack!
brothers, i lost!


doesn't matter.
my brothers will
repay the favor!


a child intruder?
that must be you!


fine!
i lost!


go on home
before my boss
gets ticked off!


sony: what
kept you ninten?


sony: hahaha!
i thought you'd
turn up if i
waited here!

i guess team
rocket slowed you
down! not that i
care!

i saw you in
saffron, so i
decided to see if
you got better!


oh ho!
so, you are ready
for boss rocket!


sony: how can
i put this?

you're not good
enough to play
with us big boys!


well, ninten!

i'm moving on up
and ahead!

by checking my
pokédex, i'm
starting to see
what's strong and
how they evolve!

i'm going to the
pokémon league
to boot out the
elite four!

i'll become the
world's most
powerful trainer!

ninten, well
good luck to you!
don't sweat it!
smell ya!


i wonder if silph
is finished...


thanks for saving
us!


that's as far as
you'll go!


not
enough grit!


if you don't turn
back, i'll call
for backup!


you're causing us
problems!


huh?
i lost?


so, what do you
think of silph
building's maze?


i am one of the 4
rocket brothers!


whoo!
oh brothers!


i'll leave you up
to my brothers!


you look tired!
you should take a
quick nap!


don't give up!


thank you so
much!


your pokémon seem
to adore you, kid!


ghaaah!


if i had started
as a trainer at
your age...


your pokémon have
weak points! i
can nail them!


you
hammered me!


exploiting weak
spots does work!
think about
element types!


i am one of the 4
rocket brothers!


warg!
brothers, i lost!


my brothers will
avenge me!


waaaaa!
i'm scared!


please keep quiet
about my crying!


welcome to the
10f! so good of
you to join me!


i'm
stunned!


nice try, but the
boardroom is up
one more floor!


enough of your
silly games!


no
continues left!


are you satisfied
with beating me?
then go on home!


president: thank
you for saving
silph!

i will never
forget you saved
us in our moment
of peril!

i have to thank
you in some way!

because i am rich,
i can give you
anything!

here, maybe this
will do!


ninten got a
!


president: you
can't buy that
anywhere!

it's our secret
prototype master
ball!

it will catch any
pokémon without
fail!

you should be
quiet about using
it, though.


you have no
room for this.


secretary: thank
you for rescuing
all of us!

we admire your
courage.


ah ninten!
so we meet again!

the president and
i are discussing
a vital business
proposition.

keep your nose
out of grown-up
matters...

or, experience a
world of pain!


arrgh!!
i lost again!?


blast it all!
you ruined our
plans for silph!

but, team rocket
will never fall!

ninten! never
forget that all
pokémon exist
for team rocket!

i must go, but i
shall return!


stop right there!
don't you move!


don't...
please!


so, you want to
see my boss?


halt! do you have
an appointment
with my boss?


gaah!
demolished!


watch your step,
my boss likes his
pokémon tough!

lost out!


i never wanted to
lose to anybody!


i can see you're
good! let me see
exactly how good!


i
had a chance...


i concede, you're
better than me!


ah! i heard about
you ninten!

i lead the elite
four! you can
call me lance the
dragon trainer!

you know that
dragons are
mythical pokémon!

they're hard to
catch and raise,
but their powers
are superior!

they're virtually
indestructible!

well, are you
ready to lose?

your league
challenge ends
with me, ninten!


that's it!

i hate to admit
it, but you are a
pokémon master!


i still can't
believe my
dragons lost to
you, ninten!

you are now the
pokémon league
champion!

...or, you would
have been, but
you have one more
challenge ahead.

you have to face
another trainer!
his name is...

sony!
he beat the elite
four before you!

he is the real
pokémon league
champion!


oak: er-hem!
congratulations
ninten!

this floor is the
pokémon hall of
fame!

pokémon league
champions are
honored for their
exploits here!

their pokémon are
also recorded in
the hall of fame!

ninten! you have
endeavored hard
to become the new
league champion!

congratulations,
ninten, you and
your pokémon are
hall of famers!


sony: hey!

i was looking
forward to seeing
you, ninten!

my rival should
be strong to keep
me sharp!

while working on
pokédex, i looked
all over for
powerful pokémon!

not only that, i
assembled teams
that would beat
any pokémon type!

and now!

i'm the pokémon
league champion!

ninten! do you
know what that
means?

i'll tell you!

i am the most
powerful trainer
in the world!


no!
that can't be!
you beat my best!

after all that
work to become
league champ?

my reign is over
already?
it's not fair!


hahaha!
i won, i won!

i'm too good for
you, ninten!

you did well to
even reach me,
sony, the
pokémon genius!

nice try, loser!
hahaha!


why?
why did i lose?

i never made any
mistakes raising
my pokémon...

darn it! you're
the new pokémon
league champion!

although i don't
like to admit it.


oak: ninten!


oak: so, you won!
congratulations!
you're the new
pokémon league
champion!

you've grown up so
much since you
first left with
!

ninten, you have
come of age!


oak: sony! i'm
disappointed!

i came when i
heard you beat
the elite four!

but, when i got
here, you had
already lost!

sony! do you
understand why
you lost?

you have forgotten
to treat your
pokémon with
trust and love!

without them, you
will never become
a champ again!


oak: ninten!

you understand
that your victory
was not just your
own doing!

the bond you share
with your pokémon
is marvelous!

ninten!
come with me!


welcome to
pokémon league!

i am lorelei of
the elite four!

no one can best

you only got a
taste of pokémon
league power!

down with our

challenge!

you, child!

you how a real

hello there!
welcome to the
world of pokémon!

my name is oak!
people call me
the pokémon prof!


this world is
inhabited by
creatures called
pokémon!


for some people,
pokémon are
pets. others use
them for fights.

myself...

i study pokémon
as a profession.


first, what is
your name?


this is my grand-
son. he's been
your rival since
you were a baby.

...erm, what is
his name again?


ninten!

your very own
pokémon legend is
about to unfold!

a world of dreams
and adventures
with pokémon
awaits! let's go!


do you want to
give a nickname
to ?


right! so your
name is ninten!


that's right! i
remember now! his
name is sony!


and
 will
be traded.


m9 error.


i went to rock
tunnel, but it's
dark and scary.

if a pokémon's
flash could light
it up...


many pokémon live
only in forests
and caves.

you need to look
everywhere to get
different kinds!


have you noticed
the bushes on the
roadside?

they can be cut
down by a special
pokémon move.


a fainted pokémon
can't fight. but,
it can still use
moves like cut!


the hm flash
lights even the
darkest dungeons.


once a pokémon
learns flash, you
can get through
rock tunnel.


are you going to
viridian forest?
be careful, it's
a natural maze!


rattata may be
small, but its
bite is wicked!
did you get one?


i've 6 poké balls
set in my belt.

at most, you can
carry 6 pokémon.


team rocket
attacks cerulean
citizens...

team rocket is
always in the
news!


man: hello, there!
have i got a deal
just for you!

i'll let you have
a swell magikarp
for just ¥500!
what do you say?


no? i'm only
doing this as a
favor to you!


you'll need more
money than that!


man: well, i don't
give refunds!


i'm on guard duty.
gee, i'm thirsty,
though!

oh wait there,
the road's closed.


whoa, boy!
i'm parched!
...
huh? i can have
this drink?
gee, thanks!


...
glug glug...
...
gulp...
if you want to go
to saffron city...
...
you can go on
through. i'll
share this with
the other guards!


hi, thanks for
the cool drinks!


i run a daycare.
would you like me
to raise one of
your pokémon?


which pokémon
should i raise?


fine, i'll look
after
for a while.


come see me in
a while.


your
has grown a lot!

by level, it's
grown by !

aren't i great?


you owe me ¥
for the return
of this pokémon.


ninten got
 back!


back already?
your
needs some more
time with me.


all right then,
come again.


you have no room
for this pokémon!


you only have one
pokémon with you.


i can't accept a
pokémon that
knows an hm move.


thank you! here's
your pokémon!


hey, you don't
have enough ¥!


people often lose
things in that
underground path.


i heard a sleepy
pokémon appeared
near celadon city.


i want to shop at
the dept. store
in celadon but...

there are so many
rough looking
people there.


team rocket had a
secret hideout in
celadon city?


you're here to
shop in celadon?

just step outside
and head west!


the underground
path goes beneath
saffron and leads
to lavender.

if you're heading
to cerulean, go
to the building
across the road.


the dept. store
in celadon has a
great selection!


the element types
of pokémon make
them stronger
than some types
and weaker than
others!


i sold a useless
nugget for ¥5000!


this tunnel goes
a long way, kid!


doh!
you win!


watch for onix!
it can put the
squeeze on you!


hmm. maybe i'm
lost in here...


ease up!
what am i doing?
which way is out?


that sleeping
pokémon on route
12 forced me to
take this detour.


outsiders like
you need to show
me some respect!


i give!


you're talented
enough to hike!


pokémon fight!
ready, go!


game
over!


oh well, i'll get
a zubat as i go!


eek! don't try
anything funny in
the dark!


it
was too dark!


i saw a machop
in this tunnel!


i came this far
for pokémon!


i'm
out of pokémon!


you looked cute
and harmless!


you have pokémon!
let's start!


you
play hard!


whew! i'm all
sweaty now!


rock tunnel
cerulean city -
lavender town


bzzzt!


gyaoo!


when you catch
lots of pokémon,
isn't it hard to
think up names?

in lavender town,
there's a man who
rates pokémon
nicknames.

he'll help you
rename them too!


there are items on
the ground that
can't be seen.

itemfinder will
detect an item
close to you.

it can't pinpoint
it, so you have
to look yourself!


looked into the
binoculars.

a big pokémon is
asleep on a road!


looked into the
binoculars.

it's a beautiful
view!


looked into the
binoculars.

the only way to
get from cerulean
city to lavender
is by way of the
rock tunnel.


what a surprise!
digletts dug this
long tunnel!

it goes right to
viridian city!


there's a lookout
spot upstairs.


my pokémon's
ashes are stored
in pokémon tower.

you can have this
tm. i don't need
it any more...


ninten received
tm39!


tm39 is a move
called swift.

it's very accurate,
so use it during
battles you can't
afford to lose.


you don't have
room for this.


looked into the
binoculars.

a man fishing!


looked into the
binoculars.

it's pokémon tower!


i'm the fishing
guru's brother!

i simply looove
fishing!

do you like to
fish?


grand! i like
your style!

take this and
fish, young one!

ninten received
a !


fishing is a way
of life!

from the seas to
rivers, go out
and land the big
one!


oh... that's so
disappointing...


hello there,
ninten!

use the super rod
in any water!
you can catch
different kinds
of pokémon.

try fishing
wherever you can!


oh no!

i had a gift for
you, but you have
no room for it!


are you working
on a pokédex?

prof.oak's aide
came by here.


exp.all gives
exp points to all
the pokémon with
you, even if they
don't fight.

it does, however,
reduce the amount
of exp for each
pokémon.

if you don't need
it, you should
store it via pc.


looked into the
binoculars.

it looks like a
small island!


no pedestrians
are allowed on
cycling road!


cycling road is a
downhill course
by the sea. it's
a great ride.


excuse me! wait
up please!


how'd you get in?
good effort!


i'm going for a
ride with my girl
friend!


we're going
riding together!


looked into the
binoculars.

it's celadon dept.
store!


looked into the
binoculars.

there's a long
path over water!


oh, you found my
secret retreat!

please don't tell
anyone i'm here.
i'll make it up
to you with this!


ninten received
hm02!


hm02 is fly.
it will take you
back to any town.

put it to good
use!


you don't have any
room for this.


fearow: kyueen!


you need a bicycle
for cycling road!


cycling road is
all uphill from
here.


excuse me!


looked into the
binoculars.

pallet town is in
the west!


looked into the
binoculars.

there are people
swimming!


only truly skilled
trainers are
allowed through.

you don't have the
boulderbadge yet!


the rules are
rules. i can't
let you pass.


oh! that is the
boulderbadge!
go right ahead!


gyaoo!


victory road is
the final test
for trainers!


aiyah!


if you get stuck,
try moving some
boulders around!


ah, so you wish
to challenge the
elite four?


you
got me!


sony also came
through here!


come on!
i'll whip you!


i got
whipped!


you earned the
right to be on
victory road!


if you can get
through here, you
can go meet the
elite four!


no!
unbelievable!


i can beat you
when it comes to
knowledge about
pokémon!


is victory road
too tough?


well
done!


many trainers give
up the challenge
here.


hiya! i'm a
pokémon...
...no i'm not!

call me bill!
i'm a true blue
pokémaniac! hey!
what's with that
skeptical look?

i'm not joshing
you, i screwed up
an experiment and
got combined with
a pokémon!

so, how about it?
help me out here!


when i'm in the
teleporter, go to
my pc and run the
cell separation
system!


no!? come on, you
gotta help a guy
in deep trouble!

what do you say,
chief? please?
ok? all right!


bill: yeehah!
thanks, bud! i
owe you one!

so, did you come
to see my pokémon
collection?
you didn't?
that's a bummer.

i've got to thank
you... oh here,
maybe this'll do.


ninten received
an !


you've got too
much stuff, bud!


that cruise ship,
s.s.anne, is in
vermilion city.
its passengers
are all trainers!

they invited me
to their party,
but i can't stand
fancy do's. why
don't you go
instead of me?


bill: look, bud,
just check out
some of my rare
pokémon on my pc!


hi! i work at a
pokémon mart.

it's a convenient
shop, so please
visit us in
viridian city.

i know, i'll give
you a sample!
here you go!


ninten got

we also carry
poké balls for
catching pokémon!


you have too much

quicker that way.

there are other

i don't
believe it!

your pokémon on

hold 20 pokémon!


you looked at me,
didn't you?


you're
mean!


quit staring if
you don't want to
fight!


are you a trainer?
let's fight!


if i
had new pokémon i
would've won!


if a pokémon box
on the pc gets
full, just switch
to another box!


that look you
gave me, it's so
intriguing!


be nice!


avoid fights by
not letting
people see you!


hey! you're not

i always wear

you need strategy
to win at this!


it's
not logical!


go with grimer
first...and...
...and...then...


i like nidoran, so

when pokémon grow
up they get ugly!
they shouldn't
evolve!


school is fun, but
so are pokémon.


i'll
stay with school.


we're stuck here
because of the
gates at saffron.


meowth is so cute,

waiting game!


that
one got away!


with a better rod,
i could catch
better pokémon!

oww!


i could have made
my pokémon evolve

pokémon!

hmm? my birds are
shivering! you're
good, aren't you?

i raise pokémon

quiet getaway!

there's a huge
cavern underneath
this island.


i love floating
with the fishes!


yowch!


want to float
with me?

vacation too?


no
mercy at all!


seafoam used to
be one island!


check out my buff
physique!


wimpy!


i should've been
buffing up my
pokémon, not me!


why are you
riding a pokémon?
can't you swim?


ouch!
torpedoed!


riding a pokémon
sure looks fun!


i rode my bird
pokémon here!


oh
no!


my birds can't
fly me back!


my boy friend gave
me big pearls!


don't
touch my pearls!


will my pearls
grow bigger
inside cloyster?


i swam here from
cinnabar island!


i'm
so disappointed!


pokémon have
taken over an
abandoned mansion
on cinnabar!


cinnabar, in the
west, has a lab
for pokémon.


wait!


cinnabar is a
volcanic island!


seafoam islands


you want to know
if the fish are
biting?


dang!


i can't catch
anything good!


i got a big haul!
wanna go for it?


darn
magikarp!


i seem to only
catch magikarp!


the sea cleanses
my body and soul!


ayah!


i like the
mountains too!


what's wrong with
me swimming?


cheap
shot!


i look like what?
a studded inner
tube? get lost!


i caught all my
pokémon at sea!


diver!!
down!!


where'd you catch
your pokémon?


right now, i'm in
a triathlon meet!


pant...
pant...pant...


i'm beat!
but, i still have
the bike race and
marathon left!


ahh! feel the sun
and the wind!


yow!
i lost!


i'm sunburnt to a
crisp!


hey, don't scare
away the fish!


sorry!
i didn't mean it!


i was just angry
that i couldn't
catch anything.


keep me company
'til i get a hit!


that
burned some time.


oh wait! i got a
bite! yeah!


sony: hey!
ninten!

you're going to
pokémon league?

forget it! you
probably don't
have any badges!

the guard won't
let you through!

by the way, did
your pokémon
get any stronger?


i heard pokémon
league has many
tough trainers!

i have to figure
out how to get
past them!

you should quit
dawdling and get
a move on!


awww!
you just lucked
out!


sony: what?
why do i have 2
pokémon?

you should catch
some more too!


sony: what?
ninten! what a
surprise to see
you here!

so you're going to
pokémon league?

you collected all
the badges too?
that's cool!

then i'll whip you
ninten as a
warm up for
pokémon league!

up! i'm ready for
pokémon league!

all pokémon have
weaknesses. it's

different kinds.


dad took me to a
great party on
s.s.anne at
vermilion city!


i'm
not mad!


on s.s.anne, i
saw trainers from
around the world.


i'm a cool guy.
i've got a girl
friend!


aww,
darn...


oh well. my girl
will cheer me up.


hi! my boy
friend is cool!


i was in
bad condition!


i wish my guy was
as good as you!


i knew i had to
fight you!


i knew
i'd lose too!


if your pokémon
gets confused or
falls asleep,
switch it!


my friend has a
cute pokémon.
i'm so jealous!


i'm
not so jealous!


you came from mt.
moon? may i have
a clefairy?


i just got down
from mt.moon,
but i'm ready!


you
worked hard!


drat!
a zubat bit me
back in there.

mom: right.
all boys leave
home some day.
it said so on tv.

prof.oak, next
door, is looking
for you.


mom: ninten!
you should take a
quick rest.


mom: oh good!
you and your
pokémon are
looking great!
take care now!


there's a movie
on tv. four boys
are walking on
railroad tracks.

i better go too.


oops, wrong side.


hi ninten!
sony is out at
grandpa's lab.


grandpa asked you
to run an errand?
here, this will
help you!


ninten got a
!


you have too much
stuff with you.


use the town map
to find out where
you are.


pokémon are living
things! if they
get tired, give
them a rest!


it's a big map!
this is useful!


sony: yo
ninten! gramps
isn't around!


sony: heh, i
don't need to be
greedy like you!

go ahead and
choose, ninten!


sony: my
pokémon looks a
lot stronger.


those are poké
balls. they
contain pokémon!


so! you want the
fire pokémon,
charmander?


so! you want the
water pokémon,
squirtle?


so! you want the
plant pokémon,
bulbasaur?


this pokémon is
really energetic!


ninten received
a !


that's prof.oak's
last pokémon!


oak: now, ninten,
which pokémon do
you want?


oak: if a wild
pokémon appears,
your pokémon can
fight against it!


oak: ninten,
raise your young
pokémon by making
it fight!


oak: oh, ninten!

how is my old
pokémon?

well, it seems to
like you a lot.

you must be
talented as a
pokémon trainer!

what? you have
something for me?

ninten delivered
oak's parcel.


ah! this is the
custom poké ball
i ordered!
thank you!


pokémon around the
world wait for
you, ninten!


oak: you can't get
detailed data on
pokémon by just
seeing them.

you must catch
them! use these
to capture wild
pokémon.

ninten got 5
poké balls!


when a wild
pokémon appears,
it's fair game.

just throw a poké
ball at it and try
to catch it!

this won't always
work, though.

a healthy pokémon
could escape. you
have to be lucky!


oak: come see me
sometimes.

i want to know how
your pokédex is
coming along.


oak: good to see
you! how is your
pokédex coming?
here, let me take
a look!


it's encyclopedia-
like, but the
pages are blank!


?


prof.oak is the
authority on
pokémon!

many pokémon
trainers hold him
in high regard!


sony: gramps!
i'm fed up with
waiting!


oak: sony?
let me think...

oh, that's right,
i told you to
come! just wait!

here, ninten!

there are 3
pokémon here!

haha!

they are inside
the poké balls.

when i was young,
i was a serious
pokémon trainer!

in my old age, i
have only 3 left,
but you can have
one! choose!


sony: hey!
gramps! what
about me?


oak: be patient!
sony, you can
have one too!


oak: hey! don't go
away yet!


sony: i'll take
this one, then!


sony received
a !


sony: wait
ninten!
let's check out
our pokémon!

come on, i'll take
you on!


what?
unbelievable!
i picked the
wrong pokémon!


sony: yeah! am
i great or what?


sony: okay!
i'll make my
pokémon fight to
toughen it up!

ninten! gramps!
smell you later!


sony: gramps!


sony: what did
you call me for?


oak: oh right! i
have a request
of you two.


on the desk there
is my invention,
pokédex!

it automatically
records data on
pokémon you've
seen or caught!

it's a hi-tech
encyclopedia!


oak: ninten and
sony! take
these with you!

ninten got
pokédex from oak!


to make a complete
guide on all the
pokémon in the
world...

that was my dream!

but, i'm too old!
i can't do it!

so, i want you two
to fulfill my
dream for me!

get moving, you
two!

this is a great
undertaking in
pokémon history!


sony: alright
gramps! leave it
all to me!

ninten, i hate to
say it, but i
don't need you!

i know! i'll
borrow a town map
from my sis!

i'll tell her not
to lend you one,
ninten! hahaha!


i study pokémon as
prof.oak's aide.


pokédex comp-
letion is:

 pokémon seen
 pokémon owned

prof.oak's
rating:


you still have
lots to do.
look for pokémon
in grassy areas!


you're on the
right track!
get a flash hm
from my aide!


you still need
more pokémon!
try to catch
other species!


good, you're
trying hard!
get an itemfinder
from my aide!


looking good!
go find my aide
when you get 50!


you finally got at
least 50 species!
be sure to get
exp.all from my
aide!


ho! this is geting
even better!


very good!
go fish for some
marine pokémon!


wonderful!
do you like to
collect things?


i'm impressed!
it must have been
difficult to do!


you finally got at
least 100 species!
i can't believe
how good you are!


you even have the
evolved forms of
pokémon! super!


excellent! trade
with friends to
get some more!


outstanding!
you've become a
real pro at this!


i have nothing
left to say!
you're the
authority now!


your pokédex is
entirely complete!
congratulations!


you can use that
pc in the corner.

the receptionist
told me. so kind!


there's a pokémon
center in every
town ahead.

they don't charge
any money either!


okay! say hi to
prof.oak for me!


hey! you came from
pallet town?


you know prof.
oak, right?

his order came in.
will you take it
to him?

ninten got
oak's parcel!


this shop sells
many antidotes.


no! potions are
all sold out.


whew! i'm trying
to memorize all
my notes.


okay!

be sure to read
the blackboard
carefully!


coming up with
nicknames is fun,
but hard.

simple names are
the easiest to
remember.


my daddy loves
pokémon too.


speary: tetweet!


spearow
name: speary


fwahahaha! this is
my hideout!

i planned to
resurrect team
rocket here!

but, you have
caught me again!
so be it! this
time, i'm not
holding back!

once more, you
shall face
giovanni, the
greatest trainer!


ha!
that was a truly
intense fight!
you have won!
as proof, here is
the earthbadge!


having lost, i
cannot face my
underlings!
team rocket is
finished forever!

i will dedicate my
life to the study
of pokémon!

let us meet again
some day!
farewell!


the earthbadge
makes pokémon of
any level obey!

it is evidence of
your mastery as a
pokémon trainer!

with it, you can
enter the pokémon
league!

it is my gift for
your pokémon
league challenge!


ninten received
tm27!


tm27 is fissure!
it will take out
pokémon with just
one hit!

i made it when i
ran the gym here,
too long ago...


you do not have
space for this!


heh! you must be
running out of
steam by now!


i
ran out of gas!


you need power to
keep up with our
gym leader!


rrrroar! i'm
working myself
into a rage!


wargh!


i'm still not
worthy!


pokémon and i, we
make wonderful
music together!


you are in
perfect harmony!


do you know the
identity of our
gym leader?


karate is the
ultimate form of
martial arts!


atcho!


if my pokémon
were as good at
karate as i...


the truly talented
win with style!


i
lost my grip!


the leader will
scold me!


i'm the karate
king! your fate
rests with me!


ayah!


pokémon league?
you? don't get
cocky!


your pokémon will
cower at the
crack of my whip!


yowch!
whiplash!


wait! i was just
careless!


viridian gym was
closed for a long
time, but now our
leader is back!


i
was beaten?


you can go onto
pokémon league
only by defeating
our gym leader!


yo! champ in
making!

even i don't know
viridian leader's
identity!

this will be the
toughest of all
the gym leaders!

i heard that the
trainers here
like ground-type
pokémon!


blow me away!
giovanni was the
gym leader here?


come again!


it's ¥50 for a
child's ticket.

would you like to
come in?


right, ¥50!
thank you!


you don't have
enough money.


you can't sneak
in the back way!

oh, whatever!
do you know what
amber is?


there's a lab
somewhere trying
to resurrect
ancient pokémon
from amber.


amber is fossil-
ized tree sap.


please go to the
other side!


take plenty of
time to look!


that is one
magnificent
fossil!


ssh! i think that
this chunk of
amber contains
pokémon dna!

it would be great
if pokémon could
be resurrected
from it!

but, my colleagues
just ignore me!

so i have a favor
to ask!

take this to a
pokémon lab and
get it examined!


ninten received
old amber!


ssh! get the old
amber checked!


you don't have
space for this!


we are proud of 2
fossils of very
rare, prehistoric
pokémon!


the amber is
clear and gold!


moon stone?

what's so special
about it?


july 20, 1969!

the 1st lunar
landing!

i bought a color
tv to watch it!


we have a space
exhibit now.


i want a pikachu!
it's so cute!

i asked my daddy
to catch me one!


yeah, a pikachu
soon, i promise!


space shuttle
columbia


meteorite that
fell on mt.moon.
(moon stone?)


i'm brock!
i'm pewter's gym
leader!

i believe in rock
hard defense and
determination!

that's why my
pokémon are all
the rock-type!

do you still want
to challenge me?
fine then! show
me your best!


there are all
kinds of trainers
in the world!

you appear to be
very gifted as a
pokémon trainer!

go to the gym in
cerulean and test
your abilities!


wait! take this
with you!


ninten received
tm34!


a tm contains a
technique that
can be taught to
pokémon!

a tm is good only
once! so when you
use one to teach
a new technique,
pick the pokémon
carefully!

tm34 contains
bide!

your pokémon will
absorb damage in
battle then pay
it back double!


you don't have
room for this!


i took
you for granted.

as proof of your
victory, here's
the boulderbadge!

ninten received
the boulderbadge!


that's an official
pokémon league
badge!

its bearer's
pokémon become
more powerful!

the technique
flash can now be
used any time!


stop right there,
kid!

you're still light
years from facing
brock!


darn!

light years isn't
time! it measures
distance!


you're pretty hot,
but not as hot
as brock!


hiya! i can tell
you have what it
takes to become a
pokémon champ!

i'm no trainer,
but i can tell
you how to win!

let me take you
to the top!


all right! let's
get happening!


the 1st pokémon
out in a match is
at the top of the
pokémon list!

by changing the
order of pokémon,
matches could be
made easier!


it's a free
service! let's
get happening!


just as i thought!
you're pokémon
champ material!


nidoran: bowbow!


nidoran sit!


our pokémon's an
outsider, so it's
hard to handle.

an outsider is a
pokémon that you
get in a trade.

it grows fast, but
it may ignore an
unskilled trainer
in battle!

if only we had
some badges...


a shady, old man
got me to buy
this really weird
fish pokémon!

it's totally weak
and it cost ¥500!


good things can
happen if you
raise pokémon
diligently, even
the weak ones!


pokémon learn new
techniques as
they grow!

but, some moves
must be taught by
the trainer!


pokémon become
easier to catch
when they are
hurt or asleep!

but, it's not a
sure thing!


what!?

team rocket is
at mt.moon? huh?
i'm on the phone!

scram!


jigglypuff: puu
pupuu!


those miserable
rockets!

look what they
did here!

they stole a tm
for teaching
pokémon how to
dig holes!

that cost me a
bundle, it did!


i figure what's
lost is lost!

i decided to teach
diglett how to
dig without a tm!


team rocket must
be trying to dig
their way into no
good!


team rocket left
a way out!


my husband likes
trading pokémon.

if you are a
collector, would
you please trade
with him?


that bill!

i heard that
he'll do whatever
it takes to get
rare pokémon!


have you heard
about bill?

everyone calls
him a pokémaniac!

i think people
are just jealous
of bill, though.

who wouldn't want
to boast about
their pokémon?


hi, you're a new
face!

trainers who want
to turn pro have
to have a policy
about pokémon!

what is your
approach when you
catch pokémon?

my policy is an
all-out offensive
with water-type
pokémon!


tm11 teaches
bubblebeam!

use it on an
aquatic pokémon!


the cascadebadge
makes all pokémon
up to l30 obey!

that includes
even outsiders!

there's more, you
can now use cut
any time!

you can cut down
small bushes to
open new paths!

you can also have
my favorite tm!


ninten received
tm11!


you better make
room for this!


wow!
you're too much!

all right!

you can have the
cascadebadge to
show you beat me!


i'm more than good
enough for you!

misty can wait!


you
overwhelmed me!


you have to face
other trainers to
find out how good
you really are.


splash!

i'm first up!
let's do it!


that
can't be!


misty is going to
keep improving!

she won't lose to
someone like you!


yo! champ in
making!

here's my advice!

the leader, misty,
is a pro who uses
water pokémon!

you can drain all
their water with
plant pokémon!

or, zap them with
electricity!


you beat misty!
what'd i tell ya?

you and me kid,
we make a pretty
darn good team!


hi! welcome to
our bike shop.

have we got just
the bike for you!


it's a cool bike!
do you want it?


sorry! you can't
afford it!


oh, that's...

a bike voucher!

ok! here you go!


ninten exchanged
the bike voucher
for a bicycle.


come back again
some time!


how do you like
your new bicycle?

you can take it
on cycling road
and in caves!


you better make
room for this!


a plain city bike
is good enough
for me!

you can't put a
shopping basket
on an mtb!


these bikes are
cool, but they're
way expensive!


wow. your bike is
really cool!


use repel to keep
bugs and weak
pokémon away.

put your strongest
pokémon at the
top of the list
for best results!


have you seen any
rare candy?

it's supposed to
make pokémon go
up one level!


pokémon badges
are owned only by
skilled trainers.

i see you have
at least one.

those badges have
amazing secrets!


now then...

which of the 8
badges should i
describe?


come visit me any
time you wish.


the attack of all
pokémon increases
a little bit.

it also lets you
use flash any
time you desire.


pokémon up to l30
will obey you.

any higher, they
become unruly!

it also lets you
use cut outside
of battle.


the speed of all
pokémon increases
a little bit.

it also lets you
use fly outside
of battle.


pokémon up to l50
will obey you.

any higher, they
become unruly!

it also lets you
use strength out-
side of battle.


the defense of all
pokémon increases
a little bit.

it also lets you
use surf outside
of battle.


pokémon up to l70
will obey you.

any higher, they
become unruly!


your pokémon's
special abilities
increase a bit.


all pokémon will
obey you!


team rocket will
do anything for
the sake of gold!


i saw cubone's
mother die trying
to escape from
team rocket!


pokémon tower was
erected in the
memory of pokémon
that had died.


did you come to
pay respects?
bless you!


i came to pray
for my clefairy.

sniff! i can't
stop crying...


my growlithe...
why did you die?


i am a channeler!
there are spirits
up to mischief!


sony: hey,
ninten! what
brings you here?
your pokémon
don't look dead!

i can at least
make them faint!
let's go, pal!


what?
you stinker!

i took it easy on
you too!


sony: well,
look at all your
wimpy pokémon!

toughen them up a
bit more!


how's your pokédex
coming, pal?
i just caught a
cubone!

i can't find the
grown-up marowak
yet!

i doubt there are
any left! well, i
better get going!
i've got a lot to
accomplish, pal!

smell ya later!


even we could not
identify the
wayward ghosts!

a silph scope
might be able to
unmask them.


urrg...awaa...
huhu...graa..


hwa!
i'm saved!


the ghosts can be
identified by the
silph scope.


kekeke....
kwaaah!

is the ghost?


i must have been
dreaming...


be cursed with
me! kwaaah!


what!


we can't crack
the identity of
the ghosts.


huhuhu...

huh?
who? what?


may the departed
souls of pokémon
rest in peace...

sealed this space
with white magic!

urff....


whoo!


i fell to evil
spirits despite
my training!


entered purified,
protected zone!

ninten's pokémon
are fully healed!


the ghost was the
restless soul of
cubone's mother!


the mother's soul
was calmed.

it departed to
the afterlife!


give...me...
blood...


groan!


i feel anemic and
weak...


urff... kwaah!


some-
thing fell out!


hair didn't fall
out! it was an
evil spirit!


ke..ke...ke...
ke..ke...ke!!


keee!


what's going on
here?


be gone...
intruders...


mr.fuji: heh? you
came to save me?

thank you. but, i
came here of my
own free will.

i came to calm
the soul of
cubone's mother.

i think marowak's
spirit has gone
to the afterlife.

i must thank you
for your kind
concern!

follow me to my
home, pokémon
house at the foot
of this tower.


what do you want?
why are you here?


i give up!


i'm not going to
forget this!


this old guy came
and complained
about us harming
useless pokémon!

we're talking it
over as adults!


please!
no more!


pokémon are only
good for making
money!

stay out of our
business!


you're not saving
anyone, kid!


don't
fight us rockets!


you're not getting
away with this!


that's odd, mr.fuji
isn't here.
where'd he go?


mr.fuji had been
praying alone for
cubone's mother.


this is really
mr.fuji's house.

he's really kind!

he looks after
abandoned and
orphaned pokémon!


it's so warm!
pokémon are so
nice to hug!


psyduck: gwappa!


nidorino: gaoo!

you know revive?

someone must have
soothed its
restless soul!


hello, hello!
i am the official
name rater!

want me to rate
the nicknames of
your pokémon?


which pokémon
should i look at?


 , is it?
that is a decent
nickname!

but, would you
like me to give
it a nicer name?

how about it?


fine! what should
we name it?


ok! this pokémon
has been renamed
!

that's a better
name than before!


fine! come any
time you like!


, is it?
that is a truly
impeccable name!

take good care of
!


even if they are
the same level,
pokémon can have
very different
abilities.

a pokémon raised
by a trainer is
stronger than one
in the wild.


my pokémon was
poisoned! it
fainted while we
were walking!


won't you admire
my pikachu's
adorable tail?


humph! my pikachu
is twice as cute
as that one!

hear my story!


hello, ninten!

did you come see
me about my
pokémon again?

no? too bad!


make room for
this!


our chairman is
very vocal about
pokémon.


let's all listen
politely to other
trainers!


if someone brags,
brag right back!


there are evil
people who will
use pokémon for
criminal acts.

team rocket
traffics in rare
pokémon.

they also abandon
pokémon that they
consider not to
be popular or
useful.


i think pokémon
can be good or
evil. it depends
on the trainer.


hey, kid! what do
you think you're
doing here?

you won't live
long in combat!
that's for sure!

i tell you kid,
electric pokémon
saved me during
the war!

they zapped my
enemies into
paralysis!

the same as i'll
do to you!


a little word of
advice, kid!

electricity is
sure powerful!

but, it's useless
against ground-
type pokémon!


the thunderbadge
cranks up your
pokémon's speed!

it also lets your
pokémon fly any
time, kid!

you're special,
kid! take this!

lt.surge said he

this is no place

wow!
surprised me!


lt.surge set up
double locks!
here's a hint!

when you open the
1st lock, the 2nd
lock is right
next to it!


yo! champ in
making!

lt.surge has a
nickname. people
refer to him as
the lightning
american!

he's an expert on
electric pokémon!

birds and water
pokémon are at
risk! beware of
paralysis too!

lt.surge is very
cautious!

you'll have to
break a code to
get to him!


whew! that match
was electric!

i would never
collect pokémon

unattractive.


the rainbowbadge

why did she bring

what about cards

safari zone's

all his teeth are

hmm? you've met

he's my grandson!

he always liked

bill files his

good luck!


did you get a
good haul?
come again!


hi! is it your
first time here?


safari zone has 4
zones in it.

each zone has
different kinds
of pokémon. use
safari balls to
catch them!

when you run out
of time or safari
balls, it's game
over for you!

before you go,
open an unused
pokémon box so
there's room for
new pokémon!


sorry, you're a
regular here!


koga: fwahahaha!

very well, i
shall show you
true terror as a
ninja master!

you shall feel

poison and sleep
techniques!


humph!
you have proven
your worth!

here! take the
soulbadge!


when afflicted by
toxic, pokémon
suffer more and
more as battle
progresses!

it will surely
terrorize foes!


now that you have
the soulbadge,
the defense of
your pokémon
increases!

it also lets you
surf outside of
battle!

ah! take this
too!

strategy can beat

what?

so, you mix brawn
with brains?
good strategy!


i wanted to become
a ninja, so i
joined this gym!

master!


let's see you

after battle!


stop right there!

our invisible
walls have you
frustrated?


whoa!

you impressed me!
here's a hint!

look very closely
for gaps in the
invisible walls!


i also study the
way of the ninja
with master koga!

ninja have a long
history of using
animals!


awoo!


i still have much
to learn!


master koga comes
from a long line
of ninjas!

what did you
descend from?


dropped
my balls!


where there is
light, there is
shadow!

light and shadow!
which do you
choose?


yo! champ in

fuchsia gym is
riddled with
invisible walls!

koga might appear
close, but he's
blocked off!

you have to find
gaps in the walls
to reach him!


it's amazing how
ninja can terrify
even now!


we nicknamed the
warden slowpoke.

he and slowpoke
both look vacant!


slowpoke is very
knowledgeable

he even has some

its light enabled
blaine to find

i've been to many

so! you hurry and
give me that!

ninten handed
over !


i take a little
time!

you go for walk a
little while!


aiyah! you come
again!


you can cancel
evolution.

when a pokémon is
evolving, you can
stop it and leave
it the way it is.


do you have any
friends?

pokémon you get
in trades grow
very quickly.

i think it's
worth a try!


don't they have x
attack? it's good
for battles!


it never hurts to
have extra items!


yo! champ in
making!

at pokémon league,
you have to face
the elite four in
succession.

if you lose, you
have to start all
over again! this
is it! go for it!


from here on, you
face the elite
four one by one!

if you win, a
door opens to the
next trainer!
good luck!


my daughter is so
self-centered.
she only has a
few friends.


my daughter likes
to mimic people.

her mimicry has
earned her the
nickname copycat
around here!


chansey: chaan!
sii!


ninten: hi! do
you like pokémon?

ninten: uh no, i
just asked you.

ninten: huh?
you're strange!

copycat: hmm?
quit mimicking?

but, that's my
favorite hobby!


oh wow!
a poké doll!

for me?
thank you!

you can have
this, then!


ninten received
!

favorite, mimic!

use it on a good
pokémon!


ninten: hi!
thanks for tm31!

ninten: pardon?

ninten: is it
that fun to mimic
my every move?

copycat: you bet!
it's a scream!

this?

i hear you're
good! show me!


judge!
1 point!


our master is a
pro fighter!


nothing tough
frightens me!

i break boulders

the only thing
that frightens us
is psychic power!


hoohah!

you're trespassing
in our fighting
dojo!


oof!

you want the

hitmonlee?

i had a vision of
your arrival!

i have had psychic
powers since i
was a child.

i first learned
to bend spoons
with my mind.

i dislike fight-
ing, but if you
wish, i will show
you my powers!


i'm
shocked!
but, a loss is a
loss.

i admit i didn't
work hard enough
to win!

you earned the
marshbadge!


everyone has
psychic power!
people just don't
realize it!


the marshbadge
makes pokémon up
to l70 obey you!

stronger pokémon
will become wild,
ignoring your
orders in battle!

just don't raise
your pokémon too
much!

wait, please take
this tm with you!


ninten received
tm46!


tm46 is psywave!
it uses powerful
psychic waves to
inflict damage!


your pack is full
of other items!


yo! champ in
making!

sabrina's pokémon
use psychic power
instead of force!

fighting pokémon
are weak against
psychic pokémon!

they get creamed
before they can
even aim a punch!


psychic power,
huh?

if i had that,
i'd make a bundle
at the slots!


sabrina is younger
than i, but i
respect her!


not
good enough!


in a battle of
equals, the one
with the stronger
will wins!

if you wish
to beat sabrina,
focus on winning!


does our unseen
power scare you?


i never
foresaw this!


psychic pokémon
fear only ghosts
and bugs!


pokémon take on
the appearance of
their trainers.

your pokémon must
be tough, then!


i knew
it!


i must teach
better techniques
to my pokémon!


you know that
power alone isn't
enough!


i don't
believe this!


sabrina just wiped
out the karate
master next door!


you and i, our
pokémon shall
fight!


i lost
after all!


i knew that this
was going to take
place.


sabrina is young,
but she's also
our leader!

you won't reach
her easily!


i lost
my concentration!


there used to be
2 pokémon gyms in
saffron.

the fighting dojo
next door lost
its gym status
when we went and
creamed them!


saffron pokémon
gym is famous for
its psychics!

you want to see
sabrina!

read your mind!
