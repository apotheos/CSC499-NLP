Problem 29
----------

*We have been using sets to store vocabularies. Try the following Python expression: `set(sent3) < set(text1)`. Experiment with this using different arguments to `set()`. What does it do? Can you think of a practical application for this?*

Applying the less than operator on two sets returns a boolean value indicating whether the left set is proper a subset of the right set. This is the same as doing `set(sent3).subset(set(text1))`.

For practical application, this could be used to check if a particular dictionary is comprehensive by comparing it against a large corpus:

```python
  oxford_english_dictionary = {
    'aardvark': 'noun; a small animal',
    'apple': 'noun; a small, red fruit that grows on trees',
    # omitted
    'zebra': 'noun; a large, horse-like black and white striped animal'
  }
  
  giant_corpus = ['peter', 'had', 'a' , 'lot', 'of', ..., 'stomach']
  
  if giant_corpus < oxford_english_dictionary:
    print 'the oxford english dictionary is comprehensive'
  else:
    print 'your dictionary is missing some words'
```
